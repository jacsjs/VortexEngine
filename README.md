# VortexEngine

A fun project I had to learn openGL and c++. 

Everything in this project is learned mainly from 3 sources, learncpp.com, Learn OpenGL and physics engine development

It is also based on a complete physics engine I wrote in java before this one, however it is sadly lost :( It had more capabilities than this unfinished engine, but only could be displayed in 2D due to java default library. Hence the backstory why I started with c++ and openGL.

My ambition was to convert this project to rust, however that is yet to be done.

This was before I knew anything about threads, so should I continue at some point for further learning purposes, threads need to be implemented properly.
